This is a very basic command-line  application designed to allow the easy download of videos from YouTube.

To use, simply enter `python3 basicpyret.py`.

Once running, the application will ask whether you are downloading from a video or playlist link.
If downloading a video link, enter `1`.
If downloading a playlist link, enter `2`.

You will then be prompted to enter the URL of the desired media and the application will immediately begin to download to the same folder as the application.
