# Pyret (Basic Edition!)
#### Video Demo:  TODO
#### Description:
This is a very basic command-line  application designed to allow users to easily download videos from YouTube.
To use, simply enter `python3 basicpyret.py` in the command-line while in the application folder.
Once running, the application will ask whether you are downloading from a video or playlist link.
- If downloading a video link, enter `1`.
- If downloading a playlist link, enter `2`.
You will then be prompted to enter the URL of the desired media and the application will immediately begin to download to `downloads/` within the application folder!
